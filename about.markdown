**Newton** is a systems programming language, that focuses primarily on fast and reusable code.

Previously called **Synthium**, **Newton** has been a passion project for a very long time now, exploring my capabilities in the compiler design and development field.

The lead development team is only comprised of two members, me and [Ethan Olchik](https://github.com/ethanolchik/).
We work on **Newton** during our free time, and this is pretty much my passion project for about 2 years now, envisioning a programming language familiar to **C**, while providing
some of the niceties from more modern programming languages. Scoped enumerators, inheritance, more granular control over memory and other features, without focusing too hard on security and safety.

Check the project's repository over at [GitHub](https://github.com/NewtonLang/newton-rs/), and show us some love. We hope to have a somewhat functional language this year, and we will be working on providing updates and new features to both the core language and tooling for the foreseeable future.
