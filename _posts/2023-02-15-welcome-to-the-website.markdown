Hey there y'all! We will be providing regular blog posts about **Newton** here, as well as announcing new stable/beta versions of the compiler and standard library.

We are also looking for contributors, people that can help with the development of the project, as well as give ideas for the language. We appreciate anything at this point!
If you are interested, please do e-mail us.

Hopefully this blog will be useful for everyone interested in the project, as well as give some insight to the actual development and ideology.

See you around!
